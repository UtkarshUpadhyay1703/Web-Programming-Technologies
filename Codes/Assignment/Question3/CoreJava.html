Java® Platform, Standard Edition & Java Development Kit
Version 11 API Specification

This document is divided into two sections:

Java SE
    The Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) APIs define the core Java platform for general-purpose computing. These APIs are in modules whose names start with java. 
JDK
    The Java Development Kit (JDK) APIs are specific to the JDK and will not necessarily be available in all implementations of the Java SE Platform. These APIs are in modules whose names start with jdk.
